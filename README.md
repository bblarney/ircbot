# ircbot
node ircbot

Currently only checks every message for urls and then tries to get the page title from the url and send it into the channel.


## installation
* clone
* update `config.js` to your liking
* `yarn`
* `node index.js`

Using tools like `forever` is recommended to keep the bot running headless.
